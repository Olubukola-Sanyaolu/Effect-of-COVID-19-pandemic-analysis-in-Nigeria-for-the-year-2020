Excel(Data cleaning) , PowerBI ( Data Visualization). Data sourced from kaggle.

### Key Insights
---

1.Disease Spread and Impact


*Peak Infection Period: March was the peak month for COVID-19 cases, with a significant decline observed in subsequent months

*Confirmed Cases by ID: Individuals identified as COV-NG040 and COV-NG039 had the highest number of confirmed cases, indicating potential super spreader events or clusters.


2.Death Toll:

The total number of deaths was 2, which, while significant, indicates a relatively low mortality rate compared to other countries


3.Economic Impact

*Stock Market: The All Share Index (NGN) trend shows a decline, particularly in Qtr 1 and Qtr 2. This suggests a significant impact on the Nigerian stock market during the initial phase of the pandemic.


*Currency Exchange Rate: The Selling Rate (NGN) trend shows a decline, likely influenced by global economic conditions and the pandemic's impact on oil prices.


*Liquid Reserves: The decline in liquid reserves suggests a potential strain on financial resources during the pandemic.
